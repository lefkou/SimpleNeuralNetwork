# Implementation of the paper "Pencil-and-Paper Neural Networks: An Undergraduate Laboratory Exercise in Computational Neuroscience"


The paper used in this repository can be found in: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26557791

Tasks implemented included:


1. Teach a 16-synapse network to pair an input pattern with an output pattern.
2. Test the trained network with an incomplete version of the input pattern.
3. Test the trained network with a noisy pattern.
4. Teach a 36-synapse network
5. Test the network with a distorted version of one of the two training patterns
6. Fraction of the synapses and parameter.
7. Calculate the maximum load parameter for the network
8. Match three inputs simultaneously.
9. Extend the implementation towards multi-layer forward neural network by adding at least one layer of
hidden neurons between the input and the output patterns
10. Provide a solution for an efficient memory storage of the synaptic matrix.
